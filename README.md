# Why we do this project? 
We believe that many people have had a problem when you go shopping in superstore or wherever .There are no employees or staff interested in you and can’t service you completely. The simplest example is a cosmetics shop at Siamone underground. Therefore, we just want something that makes us service ourselves easier and this is reason why we do this application .we can find the product with the price and information easily and we don’t have to annoyed with the service that not like service.
